Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""travel to Russia to receive my refund""",21st January 2023,TRUE,I had booked a flight from Greece to Cuba. Due to COVID it was cancelled. I accepted a voucher to travel later. Then came the war and there are no flights over Europe. I asked for my refund and the reply was that I have to travel to Russia to receive my refund from Russian territory by myself. No other options. I didn't have to visit Russia to book my ticket.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Thessaloniki to Havana via Moscow,January 2023,,,,,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""waiting for a refund for last 2.5 years""",2nd September 2022,TRUE,Has your flight been cancelled by Aeroflot themselves? Forget about your money back. You will never see them. I'm waiting for a refund for last 2.5 years!,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Dublin via Moscow,July 2022,,,,,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",30th January 2022,TRUE,"  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Moscow,January 2022,5,2,4,2,5,3,2,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""Best airline in Russia""",10th November 2021,FALSE,"  Best airline in Russia! Very nice staff, comfortable seats (I don't ask much, I mean this is coming from a girl who drives tanks), good service and power supplies, anything you can possibly ask for, enough room for my single bag, and even more room. Great service, good crew, wonderful meals, and so much more!! Ground service, I was pushed around a lot, but that isn't the staffs' fault. I don't remember turning on my in-flight entertainment system, I was too busy playing World of Tanks Blitz with the incredible WiFi.",Sukhoi Superjet 100,Business,Economy Class,Vladivostok to Grozny,August 2021,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""cabin crew were outstanding""",25th September 2021,TRUE,"  I was very impressed with the staff. Many thanks to the Aeroflot representative Nina at Larnaca, who was extremely professional, friendly and genuinely caring for her passengers. The cabin crew were outstanding as well, especially the flight attendant Asiya and the purser Irina. They did everything to make people onboard happy.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Larnaca to Moscow,September 2021,4,5,4,5,4,,4,yes
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""the whole ticket was cancelled""",21st September 2021,TRUE,"  I missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport (Moscow SVO) - when two flights of Aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx. 20 minutes, but one of them was not shown on the departure board (for some unknown reason). As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles. So, some of my flights with Aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though I travel quite often. Is there a bug not counting the miles even when you enter the frequent flyer number?",A320,Business,Economy Class,Vienna to Moscow,October 2020,2,3,3,2,1,,2,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""Overall, an okay experience""",12th September 2021,TRUE,"  Flight quite uneventful, although the hard product on Boeing 777 needs to be refurbished: it is outdated and worn. Crew were okay, although they seemed very stressed and exhausted from servicing a booked-out 777, full of families and crying babies l (on a 3-hour flight), and service felt very rushed and inattentive at times. SVO Terminal C is beautiful, but crowded and full of bottlenecks, resulting in long queues at security and long walking distances. The Malevich lounge, though, is excellent. It is well-planned and has numerous comfortable seating with amazing tarmac views and, despite being severely overcrowded, it didn’t feel like it. Overall, an okay experience, although much improvement is needed if Aeroflot wishes to achieve their ambitions of becoming a 5-star airline.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Moscow to Larnaca,September 2021,3,3,3,3,,,3,yes
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,7,"""professional and efficient crew""",3rd September 2021,TRUE," Positives: convenient booking via mobile app, very easy to upgrade from Economy to Comfort Class online, stylish new terminal C, professional and efficient crew, excellent business class-level soft product at Premium Economy (proper business class meal with metal cutlery, amenity kit, hot towels, cloth napkins). Drawbacks: B777-300ER in need of refurbishment (hopefully this is coming soon), very hard, wobbly, uncomfortable seats resulting in back pain, unaffordable internet, new terminal severely overcrowded (even worse than in the older Terminal D). Overall, a great product for a 4-hour flight, however, should if it was a long-haul flight, I would have reservations.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Premium Economy,Moscow to Larnaca,September 2021,1,4,4,3,4,3,4,yes
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""lines in Moscow airport are long""",28th August 2021,TRUE,"  Aeroflot has a good planes and good pilots, but the service was pretty bad, the lines in Moscow airport are long and disorganised, in Miami they pushed me to paid an additional PCR for couple hours of my previous test. Flight attendants let people occupy 3 chairs and sleep but you can't sit in the economy seat In front of the toilet because they call it economy comfort. They keep the plane extremely hot, normal in Russia but extremely annoying for non russian. I will avoid it if I can.",A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Moscow,August 2021,3,1,4,1,3,1,2,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8,"""service was entirely satisfactory""",16th August 2021,FALSE,"The premium economy service was entirely satisfactory. The seat doesn’t have a lot of recline, but the legroom was fine for a 6’1” (185 cm) person and I was comfortable for the whole eight-hour trip. I liked the food well enough and appreciated having actual metal cutlery (though serving wine in a paper cup seemed a bit déclassé). The entertainment system had quite a wide variety of both movies and music. There was only one W.C. for a cabin of 50+ passengers, which is the only notable demerit that I found. Price was acceptable for a last-minute trip (purchased six hours before departure); the online purchasing was simple and efficient.",,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Moscow,August 2021,4,5,4,3,4,,4,yes
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4,"""Horrible experience at Sheremetyevo Airport""",4th July 2021,TRUE,"  Horrible experience at Sheremetyevo Airport. Huge queue for check-in across the whole airport, not organized with lots of people cutting it. Very poor communication to passengers. Aeroflot representative said it is not their responsibility how their clients organize themselves in all that mess. Almost missed my flight (was called from the queue and then had to rush through passport control and security for the boarding).

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""I cannot use the e-voucher""",15th March 2021,TRUE,"  I had booked tickets for my family to visit me in Denmark in May 2020, the tickets got cancelled and no refund. I contacted customer care and they are suggesting e-voucher. I am ready to take the e-voucher but there is no flight from India to Denmark for this month, next month and in May 2021.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""refused to provide a compensation""",12th January 2021,TRUE,"  When countries announces border closure, Aeroflot did not notify me of the cancellation of the flight before the borders were closed. I learned about the flight cancellation from the media. When I phoned Aeroflot to change the date of my flight, =I had to stay in the telephone queue for around an hour, and when the operator picked up the phone, she ask me to stay on the line a minute, however went away for at least half an hour and never returned. As tickets for alternative flights were being bought by other people and prices were rising very quickly, the only realistic option was to buy a new ticket from Aeroflot for a date before the closure of borders, and then claim a refund. The price of this new ticket was several times more expensive than the original ticket. Aeroflot have refused to provide a refund for the new ticket. Aeroflot cancelled the flight due to border closure, failed to inform me about it before the border closures, failed to change the date of the flight, and refused to provide a compensation for the new ticket.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Riga to Dubai via Moscow,March 2020,,,,,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""denied boarding for no COVID test""",16th December 2020,TRUE,"  I purchased a ticket in November 2020 that had no COVID restrictions for transiting in Moscow, there is no policy for COVID testing when you transit Moscow. We were denied boarding for no COVID test, tho our destination, Turkey does not require any. We were denied boarding after being checked in, luggage tagged, boarding passes issued.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""almost 10 months to have my refund""",12th December 2020,TRUE,I bought my tickets for travel in April 2020 for my friend and I and unfortunately because of the Covid-19 my flight was cancelled. I’ve subscribe for a refund and 5 months later I still didn’t get news of it. I’ve send messages and answers was useless. So I’ve called the center the lady on the phone didn’t seem to understand what’s going on and she told me that I can’t do a refund anymore I need to do voucher. So I’ve decided to do my voucher and the website didn’t work. So I’ve sand email to the center again nd this afternoon I’ve tried the voucher with my friend name and she got her voucher back but you can only use 15% on it so how many flight I need to do to have my £800 back?. And with my name I can’t have my voucher I don’t know why for my ticket that put error.  I’ve been fighting during almost 10 months to have my refund. It shouldn’t take that time and that energy to have the money you said you’d pay me back.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Bangkok via Moscow,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""The customer service was extremely poor""",2nd November 2020,FALSE,"  My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""above and beyond any competition from other European carriers""",31st October 2020,TRUE," London to Moscow on brand new A350-900. I must say I’ve experienced one of the best business class hard products in the world. Amazing suits with doors, featuring a huge and easy to navigate IFE screen with lots of movies and music, super comfortable lie-flat seat, lots of storage space, and great touches, such as a personal wardrobe, and a locker with a mirror. Staff were amazing, food was good (although I think Aeroflot still has a room for improvement here, especially if it wants to become a 5 star airline), and ground service was quick and efficient. All in all, Aeroflot’s A350 is definitely above and beyond any competition from other European carriers.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Moscow,October 2020,5,5,4,4,5,,5,yes

I always wanted to try out their Comfort Class, and had an opportunity this time. I must say that the soft product is amazing. Excellent business class quality meals (must say, even better than in business class), highly professional, efficient and super friendly crew, good ground experience in London (many Aeroflot representatives at Heathrow, guiding and informing passengers at check in and near boarding). My big complaint though was the shell seat, which was hard to sit on, had really poor recline, and it’s footrest was quite useless. Otherwise, i loved the product and found it much more worthy in value than Aeroflot’s average European business class.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Moscow,August 2020,2,5,5,5,5,,5,yes

All seafarers hold guarantee letters from agent in the USA, from Company, issued tickets to the USA and valid c1d USA visas. But check-in and registration was refused by Aeroflot at check-in desk and their representative at Sheremetevo Airport showed low competency while refusing registration. Aeroflot representative denied accept immigration exemption of UK government for transit of seafarers with valid C1D visas, refused talking to Company representative and was rude. On hot line of Aeroflot we were told that it is unacceptable that their representative behaved like this. Because of incompetence of Aeroflot employee we lost lot of time and nerves. All was solved once this employee finished his working day and more informed and professional representative let registration for flight for our seafarers.

I will end up spending more money and time trying to solve this than the money spent on my ticket. They do not provide any solution, neither seem to care, they do not answer my emails.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""refunded fully the ticket costs""",10th August 2020,TRUE,Aeroflot refunded fully the ticket costs by clicking only only button. The process was easy and fast. My flight was not cancelled it’s just due to the new quarantine rules in the country of arrival I had to cancel the ticket. I was surprised and please to see how easy and fast the refund process is. Other airlines offer vouchers or refund only 30% of the ticket price whereas Aeroflot did it  on their website and refunded the full fare paid.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""wait 3 years for a refund""",6th August 2020,TRUE,"  Having had our flights cancelled due to covid, we were advised we could have a full refund. Several emails and calls to call centre confirmed the refund would be processed. Initially we would have the refund in 5-10 days, then 30 days then they could no longer give a time frame but rest assured our booking was in a special queue to be refunded. Flash forward to today, received an email stating we were getting a voucher. That’s it. Contacted call centre again who are now saying we can rebook or wait 3 years for a refund. Appalling customer service throughout this whole situation, €1000 down the drain as will not be flying anywhere during the voucher validity.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""Flight was officially canceled""",23rd June 2020,TRUE,"  Vilnius to Tokyo via Moscow in January 2020 was a nightmare because my luggage was damaged and I spent about a month contacting them for compensation and I've got none. Nonetheless, customer support at Moscow airport doesn't care. While people were rushing and had urgent questions, all 3 women at the counter just put a ""break 15min"" sign and left. I had a ticket back to Lithuania on June 6th from Tokyo, through Moscow. I knew that the flight will be canceled because Lithuania embassy information was 100% sure that borders will be closed for traveling from Moscow until July 1st. However, when I called airline, they said that it's not true, and they are not sure about that, I still canceled my flight, because I always buy flights with cancelation option. (Flight was officially canceled just a couple days before the departure). Their policy says that return takes around 10 working days. Its been a month and all they say is Wait.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,9,"""recommend them highly""",6th March 2020,TRUE,"  Bucharest to Moscow. My first time ever with Aeroflot and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can honestly say some of the best cabin service I have received anywhere. Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down. I will be flying with them again and will try a longer haul on a different aircraft to see how it compares.

Menu card for lunch with 2 options and in return for breakfast with 3, meals nice and tasty. Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall, great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers, e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F, which was wrong, the departure terminal was actually D, a very different one far away.

I have never had such a negative experience with any airline. They were not lifting a finger to help me, even when the flight was delayed and security process on transit was so slow that we missed our flight.

The major reason behind traveling in Aeroflot is cheaper fare for the last minute booking. Although the service quality was not very good it gave me value for money. The check in process was smooth and departing terminal was quite empty. Check in agent was courteous. Cabin crews were helpful but language was the bar.  The food quality was not so good. Particularly for the SVO-DEL flight. Not only the quality, but also quantity was very low.

Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""they are a pure disaster""",27th November 2019,TRUE," Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Stockholm via Moscow,July 2019,3,3,3,3,2,1,1,no

I was delayed due to the cyclone hitting South Korea at the time of the flight. However, the service and unfriendliness of the staff have left a bitter taste. We arrived at about 19:30. There was very little information provided. They were arranging a hotel to stay for the night, but could not announce that until 22:00. They then took the delayed passengers upstairs and left us there for a further hour with no information. They then collected us, but we then wait another hour until the coach finally came to take us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, they let us in, in small groups. We then had to be paired with strangers in one room, but that took forever. We finally made it into a hotel room at 02:00 with the flight scheduled for 05:55. They were arranging collection at 04:00, so with only 2 hours to rest, it was a terrible experience. The staff were apathetic toward all the passengers affected. They did not seem to care and just left us all confused and without information. The flights themselves were okay, but the staff were relatively unfriendly to me. I would not recommend Aeroflot.

Review covers SVO-JFK, SU100/24Sep as this was the best of the four flights. Ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional. Flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes, when loaded, depart. Schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate. Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats, decent amenities, and big, filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine; drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly, the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting; first, pre-recorded Russian/English followed by crew Russian/English announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical, ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant, willing, smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVO-TSE-SVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food, disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort. SVO is sprawling, transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance. Aeroflot was ok .... on time, with good food and comfort.

All sectors were operated by Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the planes seemed to be in very good condition from outside and in the cabin. Leg room was very good for economy class, the flight attendants were helpful and service was done in a professional manner. On the flight from Moscow to Vienna several passengers who were influenced by alcohol already when they boarded became a nuisance to all others.

For all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of check-in for flights, which I initially did not pay attention to, but which probably played a decisive role in what happened. Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

If coffee then only natural not instant and cheap Nescafe. Tasty tea. I often fly and I have something to compare. All kids are given packages with toys - this is very nice!

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""handled so poorly""",7th August 2019,TRUE,"  New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,June 2019,,,,1,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4,"""my luggage did not arrive""",30th July 2019,TRUE,"  Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow. I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board. Why not make the layover time a bit longer and avoid so many problems?",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow,July 2019,3,2,3,1,3,,3,no

Flight Attendants are genuinely welcoming and helpful, aircraft (usually Airbus) are recent, seats have a generous width & legroom (Frequent Flyers are entitled to a Space+ Seat with extra leg room, free of charge), food & wines onboard and in the business lounges are good and prices are overall competitive. You may sometimes have a flight delayed (snow at Moscow Airport in the winter, etc) - but I've experienced that Aeroflot will never let you down. They will provide drink, lunch, even hotel, and next available flight. A few months ago my flight from Bangkok to Paris was delayed, Aeroflot put me on the Thai Airways direct flight in the same day / evening and gave me a 4 star hotel + meals for the 8 hours waiting time. Moscow Airport is good, and has everything you need - restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, wifi, vending machines. I had my luggage delayed - only once in 3 years - it was delivered to my door in Paris 48 hours later, free of charge to me.

Traveling with 3 kids, they bumped me off my business class confirmed flight, without my consent and without a forwarding confirmed flight. 4 hours waited at the international ticketing desk, in an area with no water/food, with 3 young kids, since according to Russian law to enter the terminal you need to clear immigration and security. Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either.

My layover at Moscow was long, but the airport is full of amenities. Shortly prior boarding the flight to Delhi was switched from a jetway gate to a bus one, but the weather was not bad. Despite the A330-200 was full, the boarding speed was impressive. Most of travelers were Indians returning home, so it may have played a role, as I was among the very few required to show a visa to enter India. Plane is a bit old, but in good shape.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""beyond bad customer service""",27th June 2019,TRUE,"  Last week my wife and son flew Aeroflot with a 1hr 20 min connection through Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ""they will give you seats on the next flight."" The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service.

Our flight was scheduled to board at 11:20 am the next day, so at 8am we went to customer service and asked about getting our boarding passes printed. Again, we were met with staff who cared more about ignoring is then helping us. They told us to go to the gate at 11am, which we did, and it was chaos.

I am really curious why Aeroflot needs the phone support at all. The flight itself was not too bad. Most problems came from the fact that Sheremetyevo airport is extremely poorly managed, so both during inbound and outbound flight we had spent a lot of time burning fuel in the air waiting for a vacant slot.

For the dinner flight we were served a tasteless, overcooked and fatty piece of pork and the next morning the staff on the left side of the aircraft failed to serve several business class passengers, including me, our breakfast! Instead they stood in the front of the section talking to people and then cleaning up their trays before the rest of us had even been served! During the flight they never came around offering us any water. We had to go the galley and request it. ",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Paris,July 2023,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,no
Air France,2,"""I wanted to cancel my return flight""",17th July 2023,TRUE,"  I booked 2 business class tickets for myself and my 2 year old daughter. A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing. I filed a complaint to Air France, I wanted to cancel my return flight to book on another airline. This is what they responded. ""Thank you for your remarks concerning the special child meal you booked and your seat on your flight from Marseille to Singapore on July 10. Our staff reported that you were unhappy with your seat and inspected the seat. They found no defect or fault with the seat, for which reason I cannot issue any compensation in this case. There are no reports on our system indicating that the special child meal was not delivered. For this reason, I cannot respond favorably to your request. We look forward to serving your travel needs again in the near future and to welcoming you aboard another of our flights.""

Air France,1,"""There is absolutely nothing to complain about""",16th July 2023,TRUE," This was my first time flying on Air France business class product and it was nothing short of spectacular. The airplane has been in service for 21 years but extremely well-kept. The business class used on this particular aircraft was the extra legroom seats section in the very front of the aircraft, so the row had three seats, but the middle seat was not sold so it was the aisle seat and I had the window seat. The flight lasted under two hours however, the proper business cabin service was still offered. A cold towel pre-flight, and a full gourmet meal as soon as we reached cruising altitude. There is absolutely nothing to complain about, we left on time and arrived on time. Great job Air France! Merci!",A321,Business,Business Class,Barcelona to Paris,July 2023,4,5,5,4,,,5,yes
Air France,1,"""business class service was nothing short of stellar""",16th July 2023,TRUE," I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list. They are offering a business class product that the rest of their competitors in this market are not. Merci Air France for a safe and wonderful experience onboard! I'm a fan!",Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,"Paris to Newark, New Jersey",July 2023,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,yes
Air France,1,"""unresponsive customer service""",16th July 2023,TRUE," Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased. The food, wine, flight accommodations, and staff were significant changes to the flight itinerary. This was terrible! This was my elderly mother’s last international flight, and your team should be ashamed for their lack of service, deceptive and unfair practices, while not fulfilling services purchased on this flight.",,Family Leisure,Business Class,New York JFK to Paris,December 2022,4,2,1,2,1,1,1,no
Air France,1,"""Air France did not meet my expectations""",9th July 2023,TRUE," I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",,Business,Premium Economy,Munich to Ajaccio via Paris,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

I came 2 hours before the flight, they had a very long line to check in.

Air France,1,"""utter disregard for passengers""",3rd July 2023,FALSE,"  I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience. Not on the plane, on the ground, on their website or in Charles de Gaulle airport.

I went to the airport to check in just to be told that the plane had some issues and they had changed the plane to a smaller one, which meant I was on standby with a low probability to leave. After a two hour discussion with the staff, I was rerouted to Dakar, a flight supposed to take off 3 hours after my original flight, which was also delayed by one hour.",,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Nouakchott,June 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Air France,1,"""the worst airline experience we have had""",26th June 2023,TRUE," Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

Air France,4,"""pay 60 euros for hold baggage""",22nd June 2023,FALSE,"  The policy ""handbag + accessory less than 12 kg"" can be accepted as legitimate, but what happened because of its infraction was too harsh. If you go over even 2kg, as in my case, you cannot pay for extra weight. You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage, and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. (Ironically, since my bag was 10kg, less than 12kg, they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in). The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place, and it would have been a normal process.

They put me and my boyfriend on different flights home despite me being a young girl who is scared to travel alone. They are all full of attitude and are so unhelpful. I have never met such lifeless and cruel humans in my life before coming across their employees. When I explained to them that the flight they put me on would cause me to miss my university graduation, they laughed. Their chat is even more of a joke. They don’t even read what you say.

Air France,2,"""So much for Premium Economy""",19th June 2023,TRUE,"  First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags. However the was no mention of anything that they would do to compensate for our ""inconvenience.""

I spent two weeks of long hold times trying to get them on the phone. When I did, they made me fill out another form. I followed up using their messenger system which is a joke.

Air France,2,"""service and aircraft are not up to the standards""",6th June 2023,TRUE," Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards. And when you upgrade and pay extra hoping that you will get some rest and sleep the seats don’t function as per my case.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Istanbul via Paris CDG,June 2023,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,no

The guy weighing the bag was a real jerk and forced me to go check the bag. One would think that a simple one way flight without any connection would be easy enough, but apparently not.

Air France,1,"""I never received a call back""",17th May 2023,TRUE,"  Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on April 14th from Dubai to Paris. Due to the health issues of the captain we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 am. Upon arriving at the terminal an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1. At the counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) to once again find no Air France representative. I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed. I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue.

This is not fair business. We did absolutely not get what we paid for. ",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Johannesburg,April 2023,1,4,3,4,3,4,1,no
Air France,8,"""Service was exceptional""",20th April 2023,TRUE,"  Full flight, delayed departure due to strike, arrived almost on time though. Seat was a bit small due to 2-2-2 arrangement which is a little bit inappropriate for this type of aircraft.

Air France,8,"""very professional cabin crew""",19th April 2023,TRUE,"  Flight on time, last minute gate change to one at the periphery of Budapest airport.

Seat was uncomfortable though (normal Economy with empty middle seat). Mixed experience overall.",A318,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Budapest to Paris,April 2023,1,5,5,2,,,4,yes

Air France,1,"""most disgusting service""",10th April 2023,TRUE," The most disgusting service I have ever taken. They charged $150 for 3 kgs extra without allowing me to change the staff to my cabin one. I asked for a refund hoping there will be some understandable humans behind the desk but they refused even that. A total disgrace and disappointment. Please people if you ever can avoid.

Air France,9,"""Service was impeccable""",1st April 2023,TRUE,"  My first long haul flight since COVID. It was a pleasure to travel business class with Air France. The cabin layout is 1-2-1 which was excellent. Service was impeccable as expected with them. Had a choice to pre-order your preferred meal before take-off. Seat was comfortable and good entertainment on board. My only surprise was that guava juice was not available, something that was unexpected considering this is a very popular drink in Guadeloupe.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre,March 2023,4,5,4,4,4,,4,yes
Air France,3,"""my advice is avoid Air France""",28th March 2023,TRUE,"  Avoid AF if at all possible. Arrogant & rude cabin crew and the worst food I’ve ever received in the class of flight. Starting point was the cabin wasn’t fully ready even when the aircraft doors were closed ready for push back. Finally offered a welcome drink and I requested a Perrier Water but it never arrived and was later informed that, on the French national carrier, there wasn’t any. Dinner arrived and was so poor in terms of quality that I opted for some packet biscuits & chocolate. Wouldn’t have said no to some crisps but guess what - there were none. Took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the ‘dinner’ service as all bar one of the crew disappeared. The best that can be said about the breakfast meal is that at least the fruit was edible - just. At least the seat became a full flat bed but my advice is avoid Air France.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bogota to Paris,March 2023,4,1,1,4,2,,2,no
Air France,1,"""staff are arrogant and unhelpful""",25th March 2023,FALSE,I booked 3 seats next to one another and then AF changed aircraft. They split us up and the website is useless - I couldn’t even pay to have us sitting together. The support told me to sort it out at the airport. What a joke - the staff are arrogant and unhelpful and all my planning went out the window. I would not recommend anyone to fly AF if this is the way they treat their paying customers.

Air France,9,"""Pleasant crew""",24th March 2023,TRUE," Two short hops with this full service airline providing indeed full service during flights.

Air France,3,"""the crew was very friendly""",19th March 2023,TRUE,"  Disappointing flight. A very old Boeing 777, seat configuration 2-3-2 in Business. Champagne and wine were nothing special.

Air France,2,"""the slowest passport checks""",15th March 2023,TRUE,"  CDG terminal 2E, whilst spacious and clean, has a poor selection of food options, and expect to be subject to the slowest passport checks. Last call was announced before any passengers had boarded. The hidden queue had everyone standing in the air bridge for 45 minutes. Then once we finally all got seated we then sat on the gate for 1.5 hours to get an air traffic slot. No substance or apology.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Paris to London,March 2023,3,,,1,,,2,no

London flight departed late so made the connection through CDG challenging as had to go through security check again which was very slow. We went straight to gate and boarded the A350. Welcome on board drinks were offered before an on time departure. Menu with choices was offered - I was in row 7 and by time I was reached 2 out of 4 dishes were no longer available. Nice selection of wines. What surprised myself and my wife was the condition of the cabin - scratched surfaces and loose panels and poor for such a new aircraft. Pre landing meal offered to mewas nothing special.

Air France,7,"""Very excellent cabin crew""",5th March 2023,FALSE,Very excellent cabin crew flight on time seats were comfortable. Food was good had gluten free chips which I was impressed about.

Air France,9,"""Getting a refund was swift""",2nd March 2023,FALSE,"  I booked a last minute through Air France from Vancouver to Amsterdam via MSP. it was a last minute decision to take this vacation for a 5 day European getaway. While my flight got cancelled because of the snow storm in MSP, I really appreciated how proactive Air France/KLM was in cancelling the flight from MSP to AMS as the cancellation came 30 hours before the flight. Getting a refund was swift and the customer service agent on the phone was polite and a real pleasure to deal with.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Amsterdam,February 2023,,,,,,,5,yes
Air France,1,"""cabin crew were absolutely excellent""",21st February 2023,TRUE,"  Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline. I have been flying regularly since I was four years old and this was easily one of my best experiences – well up to the standard pioneered by the Middle East airlines.",A350,Business,Business Class,Atlanta to Paris CDG,February 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Air France,1,"""too late to check-in my bag""",16th February 2023,TRUE,"  AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away. They could have easily checked me into the next flight if they were only willing to be a little helpful.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,December 2022,2,5,4,1,,,1,no
Air France,8,"""makes up for it in convenience""",16th February 2023,TRUE,"  Short 1 hour flight that's perfect for people not looking for extreme budget options. Despite the relatively dated cabin interior (the plane took its first flight in 1999 according to a quick registration lookup), Air France more than makes up for it in convenience of a complimentary drink service (more than just water, but with hot and cold beverages), as well as some cookies as a snack. In addition compared to more budget options such as easyjet, AF's usage of jet bridges and the main CDG airport in Paris makes the journey overall much more convenient, as long as you don't mind spending a little more than budget offerings.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bordeaux,February 2023,4,4,3,4,2,2,3,yes
Air France,1,"""a very decent product""",13th February 2023,TRUE,"  I booked premium economy because I have knee problems. The seats are just OK (shell type that slides down but not built for a person over 6 feet), and the food is the same as economy, although it was the best fish I ever had on a plane. Overall, a very decent product, and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage, so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa. I bought what I needed for €240 and Air France reimbursed me within 10 days. Overall, very satisfied and impressed by the no fuzz reimbursement.",777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to Paris,January 2023,3,5,5,4,5,5,4,yes
Air France,8,"""I was very lucky to book early""",12th February 2023,TRUE,"  On time, in a quite comfortable seat in a duo at the back, with a wonderful clear window view, and a very informative real-time flight map. I was very lucky to book early, and paid a pittance while prices were on the floor, so good VFM. Air France is in reality operated as a budget airline, because, unlike Airasia et al, they don't sell tasty food on board. So my advice is bring a substantial picnic because, after an early lunch, you will get nothing to eat for 9 hours.  The hapless staff have nothing to offer, other than a friendly giggle or a rude dismissive shrug. Bring your own music and movies, unless you like French stuff. Don't ask cabin crew for your connection gate number, they have no interest in helping you",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Paris CDG,February 2023,4,1,1,3,1,,5,yes
Air France,8,"""expect some smiles and basic courtesy"" ",2nd February 2023,TRUE," Flight was two hours late leaving Lome. At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.  Food on Paris-Washington flight way overcooked -- dried out and unappealing appearance. Crew was very attentive, however.",A330-200 / Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Lome to Washington via Paris,February 2023,3,4,2,1,4,4,4,yes
Air France,2,"""A bad experience""",1st February 2023,TRUE,"  A bad experience with Air France. During a 9-hour flight, I waited for an hour for a glass of water. During the connection flight, they remain without sandwiches.

Air France,2,"""overall experience was very poor""",27th January 2023,TRUE,"  My business class flight fell well short of a four star carrier. The reasons for this were that pre departure drink glasses were left on the central arm rest during the take off from Bangkok, I had to hold mine down during take off. The cabin crew raced through the lunch service just after take off, then after this service the cabin crew closed the window blinds and I never saw them again until the second meal service, not once did they come around asking passengers if they wanted anything. The food quality was also poor. All take off and landing announcements from the cockpit were in French, not in English. The cabin crew manager talked to French passengers but never once spoke to me once during the flight. The 2-2-2 layout is outdated and was awful but that was my fault for choosing that specific flight. The second meal service was served too late before landing, so again it was rushed. The overall experience was very poor and I won't be in a rush to try it again.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Manchester via Paris,January 2023,1,1,2,2,,,2,no
Air France,1,"""goodbye Air France!""",25th January 2023,FALSE,"  I was taking a full-priced Delta ATL-JFK-LIS flight on January 10, 2023. Unfortunately my ATL-JFK flight was delayed, which would cause me to miss the connecting flight to LIS. Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation. What a sharp contrast between the two employees from the same company! The Air France counter person in Atlanta (I still do not know her name) was rude and was all ""snappy"" and ""powerful"" when dealing with customers. The moment she said ""I am deboarding you now!"" I knew I was not talking to a normal person. While waiting to be boarded, a few other Delta passengers complained that she also charged them luggage fees - ignoring Delta policies. ""I am deboarding you now!"" was the last nail on the coffin, goodbye Air France! No one flies just for fun, we have destinations, schedules, people to meet and things to do. I can accept Delta's delay but the power trip of deboarding at Air France must be stopped!",,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to Paris via Lisbon,January 2023,2,4,,1,,,1,no

Fortunately the cabin crew tried to help with some bread and side dishes.

Air France,9,"""customer service is outstanding""",10th January 2023,TRUE,"  Flown with Air France many times over the last 20-30 years. This flight was just a highlight about why we use Air France whenever possible. Cabin crew are very friendly, happy to have a conversation and make you feel very safe and comfortable on the flight. Short haul food is very good, and a wide range of free drinks including wine available to economy passengers is great. Luggage policies are very reasonable and it doesn’t cost much to add on extra bags or suitcases. Boarding was very efficient and both our flights were on-time. Highly recommend using AF, customer service is outstanding.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Paris,November 2022,4,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Air France,1,"""Cabin was clean and fresh""",10th January 2023,TRUE,"  HAM to CDG and return. Two short hops of 70 min each. Purchasing ticket and options via AF app was a breeze. Same for online check in. All was easy, clear and working well. At both airports I used self-serviced bag drop-off. You come to the unmanned kiosk, scan your boarding pass, then it prints your bag tag, you attach it to a bag, place the bag on the belt, scan the tag and your bag is checked. At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190. Embraer fleet have no onboard internet access, but otherwise they are more comfortable with wider seats and more legroom. Service standard was identical to AF mainline with super friendly and professional crews. HOP flights use 2G terminal at CDG which is a small regional terminal located afar from the main area where all big terminals are. It requires a separate bus ride in addition to rail or bus city link, so mind it and allow extra 20 minutes if you’re leaving from there. On my flight to Paris baggage was on the belt within 30 minutes after disembarkation, when in Hamburg it took around 20 minutes to deliver bags.",A220-300 / E190,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Paris,December 2022,4,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Air France,1,"""never fly Air France again""",9th January 2023,TRUE,"  Customer service on the phone were both incompetent and rude. Took 4 days of being told to call back in 24h and receiving no help. Every person we spoke to at the check in desk and ticketing sales was nasty. Air France customer service at LAX is awful, one older French woman at ticketing sales was aggressive in her rudeness.

Air France,2,"""baggage did not make the destination""",8th January 2023,TRUE,"  Our baggage did not make the destination airport. Air France told me initially that I will get them the day after (today) - which I have been told is no longer the case, right now I already expect them tomorrow. I live in the Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time. Followed by wasting time shopping things that you already have. How is possible that a customer can not be compensated for such a cost, waste of time, and bad experience?",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Prague via Paris,January 2023,3,3,2,1,1,2,1,no
Air France,3,"""haven't seen a penny of the compensation""",16th December 2022,TRUE,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden.

The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated.

Air France,9,"""outstanding, professional""",28th November 2022,TRUE,"  The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty.

Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row.

Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much.

Air France,2,"""No compensation for their error""",8th November 2022,TRUE,"  Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!",,Business,Business Class,Miami to Zanzibar via Paris,August 2022,3,2,1,2,1,1,1,no
Air France,9,"""Nice short trip on time""",5th November 2022,TRUE,Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight.

Air France,1,"""nothing has been reimbursed so far""",31st October 2022,TRUE,"  Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to ""pass by technical control"", while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October.

Air France,6,"""need to feel welcomed and pampered""",31st October 2022,TRUE,"  Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered.

Air France,8,"""Food was disappointing""",25th October 2022,TRUE,One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5,5,1,4,,5,5,yes
Air France,2,"""wouldn't have internet for the flight""",23rd October 2022,TRUE,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours.

Air France,1,"""reimbursed us for 15% of the value""",22nd October 2022,TRUE,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation.

Air France,1,"""cancelled flight 15 minutes before departure""",21st October 2022,TRUE,"  They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information.

Air France,1,"""hasn’t paid any compensation yet""",19th October 2022,FALSE,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.

When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight.

Air France,2,"""regret not having traveled by train""",12th October 2022,TRUE," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train.",A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3,2,1,1,,1,1,no
Air France,1,"""The food and wine was extraordinary""",10th October 2022,TRUE,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward!

Air France,2,"""everything was so uncoordinated""",3rd October 2022,TRUE," New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Stuttgart via Paris,October 2022,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,no

Air France,1,"""call centre obviously doesn't care""",30th September 2022,TRUE," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow.",,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2,2,,1,,,1,no
Air France,1,"""took them over 2 months to refund""",27th September 2022,TRUE,"  Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude.

Air France,1,"""has been improving recently""",26th September 2022,FALSE,"  Air France has been improving recently even if I already enjoyed flying this Airline,.

Air France,1,"""the staff were incredibly rude""",23rd September 2022,FALSE,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home).",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1,1,,1,,,1,no
Air France,1,"""still fight them for the proper compensation""",20th September 2022,TRUE,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less.

Air France,9,"""a pleasant flight""",8th September 2022,FALSE,"  Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty.

Air France,7,"""Thank you Air France!""",8th September 2022,TRUE," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4,3,3,3,4,4,5,yes
Air France,2,"""it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me""",7th September 2022,TRUE," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline.",,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Air France,9,"""this airline is really improving""",5th September 2022,TRUE," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4,5,5,4,5,5,4,yes
Air France,1,"""frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism""",30th August 2022,TRUE,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. ",Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2,5,2,1,,,1,no
Air France,1,"""impressed by the Air France flight crew""",26th August 2022,FALSE,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5,5,,5,,,5,yes
Air France,1,"""The refund was never made""",25th August 2022,TRUE,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so.

They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed.

A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less.

Air France,1,"""weigh their carry-on luggage""",13th August 2022,TRUE,They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3,1,,1,,,1,no
Air France,1,"""missing one checked bag""",11th August 2022,TRUE,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. ",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2,1,1,2,3,3,1,no
Air France,6,"""The in flight experience was fine""",9th August 2022,TRUE,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3,3,3,2,4,,4,yes
Air France,6,"""never encountered such incompetence""",4th August 2022,TRUE,"  Shame on Air France for its disgraceful performance and for doing nothing thus far to settle a claim for clothes and incidentals I had to buy after my luggage was delayed last December  when returning from Guinea to Washington DC in business class. I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner.

Air France,1,"""5 hours waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags""",4th August 2022,TRUE,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address.

Emirates,5,"""Cabin crew were really surly""",16th July 2023,TRUE,First the good: flight not full so seat space was more than adequate and very comfortable. Entertainment was excellent as always on Emirates. Now the not so good: meal was barely passable and did not come with a drink which as a diabetic isn't good. Cabin crew were really surly and did not speak coherent English.,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Dubai,May 2023,4,1,1,4,5,,4,yes
Emirates,8,"""let’s see if the consistency improves""",6th July 2023,TRUE,"  What a difference a crew makes. Flight from Dubai was staffed by a really engaging crew for whom nothing was too much trouble. Seat was comfortable but you can tell this was one of the older A380 as part were looking a bit worse for wear. Food on this flight was among some of the best I have ever had. Lounge was busy but to be fair we sat close to the gate and didn’t venture in. Boarding was separate to economy however we still had to wait 10 min even though when we tried it was already 10 min past the boarding time. Got the two return legs to go, let’s see if the consistency improves.",A380,Family Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to Singapore,July 2023,4,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Emirates,5,"""on-board internet simply does not work""",6th July 2023,TRUE,"  The on-board internet simply does not work. If you complain, the supplier for Emirates, 'Sita for Aircraft' simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund. It appears from multiple reviews that this happens often. Emirates themselves, apart from the non-existent internet and poor third party after-sales experience were pretty good, ample leg room, friendly staff, good selection of movies but poor food choice - fish or vegetables only. The check-in was also poor. I followed the check in signs for economy seats at Dubai airport T3, waited for around 20-30 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 (flights to USA) - i wasn't flying to the USA, how am i supposed to know to follow that sign? Very poor understanding of the customer journey.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Tel Aviv,July 2023,5,5,2,2,5,1,2,no
Emirates,1,"""I was denied check in""",4th July 2023,TRUE,"  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Tunis via Dubai,May 2023,3,1,1,1,4,3,1,no
Emirates,6,"""Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew""",4th July 2023,TRUE," Very friendly check in staff, same goes for the lounge staff, however there was only one on the front desk, and was tied up selling with upgrades or lounge access which meant that we had a 10 min wait before we got access. Lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished, how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced. Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers. Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew. Plane landed on time and for the price the service was not unreasonable.

Emirates,1,"""not even willing to listen to you""",29th June 2023,TRUE,"  Did a single booking for my family 3 months prior. Still they split the seats for a long haul 16 hour flight from Dubai to Los Angeles. Instead of giving four seat configuration. Never happened before. The folks at gate terminals very unsupportive and not even willing to listen to you. One word is what they say full flight. Would never ever fly back on this.

Emirates,7,"""a hit or miss airline""",29th June 2023,TRUE,"  I decided to fly Emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago. Well what I can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline. Some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless. What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines. I would say Emirates is still a viable option if the price is right and they offer a lot of connections, but they are not my first choice airlines if other middle eastern carriers are in the game.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Mauritius,June 2023,3,3,3,2,5,,3,yes
Emirates,2,"""Hope to see improved services""",26th June 2023,TRUE," My family experienced very poor service with Emirates, the issue was with food services, on a 16 hour flight, we get no meal selection, just have to satisfy with leftovers, we were sitting in row 86, 1st time flight attendant says they only have vegetarian meals, ran out of non-vegetarian, the same thing happens at the second meal, also on second time no beverages were served, I had call a flight attendant for beverage service. Not enough time was given to eat our food. May be Emirates would ask customers on their meal preference and stock up accordingly, no beverage services offered at all during the entire flight, we would have to walk up to the service station and ask for water/juice. Hope to see improved services on future Emirates flights.",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Houston,June 2023,3,2,1,3,3,,2,yes

Emirates,1,"""no more Emirates for us ever""",24th June 2023,TRUE,"  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Dubai via Toronto,June 2023,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,no
Emirates,9,"""a great experience""",24th June 2023,TRUE,"  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze). Overall, it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Birmingham to Dubai,June 2023,3,5,5,5,5,5,3,yes
Emirates,4,"""What a disappointment""",17th June 2023,TRUE," What a disappointment. Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such. The problem with this is that expectations are high. The hard product is good, all be it a little tatty. Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand. It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin. I had just come off a Virgin Atlantic upper class flight and while their upper class seats aren’t great, the service blows emirates out of the water. Fly better? Do better!!",A380,Business,Business Class,Glasgow to Dubai,May 2023,4,2,2,3,4,3,2,no
Emirates,1,"""sad, angry and helpless""",13th June 2023,FALSE,"  I didn't succeed to take this plane. I reserved two tickets 3 months ago and just 5 days before the flight, I found that the reservation was cancelled automatically because my bank refused the payment at the time of buying. So during these 3 months I didn't receive any email or message that notify me about this. The only email that I got it says "" Reservation confirmed"". I was really shocked when they told me that I can't find my reservation because it was already cancelled by the system automatically without any notification. After all, they kept blaming me why I didn't check my bank account every day. I have to pay extra 400 euros to book another flight in order to get home in time. Really sad, angry and helpless.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Shanghai via Dubai,June 2023,,,,,,,1,no
Emirates,1,"""certainly never fly with them again""",10th June 2023,TRUE," Emirates is an airline that tries to maximize the amount of money that it can squeeze out of customers, whilst providing the minimum possible service. I find them far less flexible than other airlines, will apply every penalty they can regardless of circumstance, and will not let customers know of the complimentary services they provide so you end up paying extra. The counter staff are generally unhelpful and impatient, and the cabin crew are less professional and appear less trained than other airlines. Definitely would NOT recommend flying with Emirates to anyone. I will certainly never fly with them again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amman to Sydney via Dubai,June 2023,2,2,2,1,3,1,1,no

Emirates,1,"""worst experience of my lifetime""",31st May 2023,TRUE,"  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water.

Emirates,1,"""bordering on criminal if not unethical""",25th May 2023,TRUE,"  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use.

Apart from the protein section of the main meal, the rest were inedible! The rolls were stale, rock hard so they were either old stock from previous meals or your caterer is taking advantage. Its carbs and carbs and carbs. Can you not include something fresh like fruit or fruit salad. Really bad Emirates, I was shocked!

Emirates,1,"""customer care is horrific""",17th May 2023,FALSE,"  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would.

Emirates,5,"""fell short of expectations""",15th May 2023,FALSE," Unfortunately, my experience on Emirates airlines in economy class from Dubai to Paris CDG fell short of expectations. While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes, I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally, at Dubai airport, I was required to use an e-boarding pass, only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary, causing inconvenience. Furthermore, the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times, seemed uninformed. Regrettably, based on this experience, I am uncertain if I would choose to fly with Emirates again.",A380,Business,Economy Class,Dubai to Paris,May 2023,3,2,2,1,2,5,2,no
Emirates,1,"""terrible, expensive travel experience""",13th May 2023,TRUE,"  I usually don't write reviews but it was a terrible, expensive travel experience and unfortunately my return is already booked with them. There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise.

Emirates,1,"""decided not to travel with Emirates""",13th May 2023,FALSE,"  Due to winter storm in Chicago, they cancelled flight from Kochi to Dubai and Dubai to Chicago. The winter storm issue was with the second flight. But they cancelled first flight because they don't want us to stay in Dubai because it will cost them accommodations and food. They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates.

Emirates,1,"""Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats""",11th May 2023,TRUE,"  I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future.

When we reported at the airline service desk, they took pictures and assured us that it would be processed very quickly. This was on March 25th. As of May 3rd, nothing! We called the call centers, multiple numbers, got handed around from one department to another who finally said, keep emailing as no one at the call center or baggage services number can help.

Check-in was smooth and hassle-free. Then, they took us to a dedicated Lounge for Special Handling which was a miserable and gloomy empty boarding lounge. As there was a Costa outlet, we wanted to have a coffee. The outlet was unstaffed and when we asked the dnata staff, she said that the outlet was closed and will remain closed. We were then taken to the boarding lounge. The boarding was done by self-boarding machines gantries. It took 30 seconds per passenger to scan the boarding pass prior to entering the lounge. The lounge was overcrowded. We waited for 50 minutes inside the boarding lounge without any announcement, nor anything on the screen. No information, no explanation for the delay.

Connection in Dubai was also not problematic; security for connecting passengers was fast-flowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777-300 but similar levels of comfort and service was  for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), the in-flight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served, the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory.

The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory.

Little did I realise that this (slight) change meant that I do not qualify for lounge access. I, after a few misrepresntations and confusing messages, was advised that I needed to be a gold member to qualify. A transit time of over five hours didn't make that experience very pleasant.

I tried to ask a member of the check-in staff if we were in the right queue and she just curtly told me yes, I was, without even asking or understanding our passenger class, so basically just a blatant lie to my face.

Emirates treatment and service on my Delhi/Barcelona flight (April 3rd) has been horrible. On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me ""don't worry"". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn't take the bus on the runway, I wouldn't make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight. How is it possible that Emirates have not foreseen all this when, the user, requests this help service at the time of purchasing the ticket, therefore, sufficiently in advance?

Hand tickets over and told you don’t have access, no explanation just handed back by some power enjoying jobs worth with no options offered. I was stunned. Checked Emirates website and it clearly states our class of travel has lounge access. This is very frustrating and an underhanded approach from Emirates. Turns out this is correct, but why on earth don’t you train staff to explain this or clearly print on the ticket / emailed ticket / purchase confirmation.

When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is “the best” he will offer and turned his back.

The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy.

The option to do so was greyed out and unavailable. I ended up paying the equivalent to $270.00 CAD for 1 extra luggage at the Emirates counter at the airport during baggage drop off. I called Emirates to complain and the customer service said it’s because it is a connecting flight from Kolkata and that option is not available. It shouldn't matter because i paid only $100 CAD during the Air Canada check in to Dubai for a stop over on the way to Kolkata.

I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year.

There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew.

Emirates,1,"""I was denied boarding""",18th February 2023,TRUE,"  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days).

Emirates,1,"""appalling way I and others were treated""",29th January 2023,TRUE,"  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines.

On the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability. From the check in counter at the Karachi airport to the transfer of the wheel chair passenger (with me) to the flight back to Houston the experience was horrible. The person working at the emirates counter in Karachi asking for a indirect bribe to the incompetent staff at the Dubai airport making us wait like a hour for wheel chair staff to transport us to the lounge as we waited for the connecting flight. When I asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how I had access I stated through Amex Business platinum. It was non of his business as an Emirates employee to ask to see my card for a lounge. The service on the plane was horrible.

I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.","1 x Boeing 777, 3 x A380",Solo Leisure,Business Class,"Cape Town to Johannesburg via Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur",January 2023,4,5,4,5,5,3,5,yes
Emirates,1,"""handed a sleeping bag with no explanation""",13th January 2023,FALSE,"  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service.

We got a few contradictory answers (and many employees’ nasty looks) and, after sitting on the luggage and floor por 40 minutes, because the request of a young couple that felt bad about my situation, the left a wheelchair at my side and no assistance. I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesn’t have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They don’t even pretend to care! I don’t know if I am going to a developed country anymore.

We were held on the tarmac for almost an hour and a half with no explanation. Not surprisingly, we missed our flight. I went to the counter to get rebooked to a new one. It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours. I contacted Emirates several times and have had no such luck in getting reimbursed. They completely ignore you. Will never fly Emirates again despite the name brand.

Emirates,1,"""definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates""",5th January 2023,FALSE,"  I can’t believe I’m writing this about Emirates since I’ve been flying with them for years but their customer service has gone down dramatically! I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly.

Emirates,5,"""has been quite disappointing"" ",2nd January 2023,TRUE,"  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices.

Emirates,2,"""the crew were nowhere to be seen""",29th December 2022,TRUE,"  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

Emirates,9,"""Food was good in general""",29th December 2022,TRUE," Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent.

Upon presenting, the passenger was advised that the ticket is not valid and the seat that was booked in not available. Advised to purchase another ticket. When told that the ticket was all paid for and e-ticket was presented, they advised that they can’t do anything and advised to contact customer care. The check in closed and the flight departed. No money was returned. After contacting the customer service, advised to lodge an investigation. When asked what to do for the time being, they advised to purchase another ticket and deal with complaints department. Another ticket was purchased. Both customer service team and complaints department advised that they cannot do anything and to deal with the bank. When challenged the decisions, the both departments simply engorged communication. Ended up being double the money out of pocket and no explanation. Would never fly again with this shade company and will advise everyone to avoid as this can happen to anyone.

Emirates,4,"""it was very disappointing""",20th December 2022,TRUE,"  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok.

Emirates,5,"""not a very good experience""",13th December 2022,TRUE," This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. ",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Dubai,December 2022,3,2,5,3,5,1,3,yes
Emirates,1,"""worse than my already very low expectations""",2nd December 2022,TRUE,"  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Dubai,December 2022,1,2,2,1,3,1,1,no

It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal.

So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great).

However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase.

Paid for seat selection and was given correct seat aisle 84c was fortunate there was empty middle seat on 14 hour flight. The Gluten Free meals which Emirates serve are excellent. The flight went smoothly and landed safely. Perhaps the only negative was water given with 2 meals and snack no cabin crew coming around with extra water between you seem to have to ask.

Emirates,1,"""hasn't been a great experience""",21st October 2022,TRUE,"  The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.",Boeing 777 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Sydney via Dubai,October 2022,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Emirates,6,"""think I would try another airline""",18th October 2022,TRUE,"  A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.",Boeing 777- 300 / A380- 800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to London via Dubia,October 2022,3,3,4,4,4,,2,yes

Lufthansa,1,"""The customer service was bad""",21st July 2023,TRUE,"  London to Berlin via Munich. The day before my scheduled flight from London - Munich was cancelled. Lufthansa shows in the app that I can get a refund straight away. I wasn't offered a different flight. I had to call the Customer Service. I was given no explanation why the flight was cancelled. The customer service was bad. I could not hear them despite the fact that I asked several times to speak up. My original flight was at 06:55, I was offered only late flights. 4 options were given via Brussels, Zurich, Frankfurt and one more which I can't remember. I chose the Zurich one as this one was the earliest one almost them all - operated by the Swiss. Upon arriving at Heathrow, everything seemed to be in order, one hour into waiting for my flight I got a message that the flight has been delayed. Immediately I went to Lufthansa's desk to check if I won't miss my Zurich - Berlin flight. I was told: don't worry Zurich-Berlin is late too and Zurich will deal with you, but this is not our problem here. 1.5 hours later we took off from Heathrow. Just before landing, we were advised by a Swiss crew what gates should we go to - connecting flights - once reaching the gate I saw on the screen Boarding. A few moments later they announced that the flight was cancelled and all passengers should go to Transit Desk. Once arrived there - a massive queue was there. Whilst waiting in the queue I called Lufthansa, once again unable to hear them, even though I asked to speak up, I was told no help will be given as I am already at the airport. Where should I be in Lufthansa’s opinion during the connecting flights? Just before I called Lufthansa I received a message on my app stating that I have been put on the flight to the same day late at night Frankfurt and then I would have to wait until the following morning for my flight to Berlin. I was already short on my trip. I got frustrated with Lufthansa's terrible customer service so I hung up. I was assisted by Swiss staff who managed to put me on a Berlin flight which was already closed. They had to override the system to get me on it. I managed to get to Berlin but missed my pre-booked coach and lost money. No help or support from Customer Service. On the way back I was supposed to fly Berlin-Munich-London.

Lufthansa,9,"""Truly excellent experience""",18th July 2023,TRUE,"  Truly excellent experience with Lufthansa. Flight delayed over 2 hours due to storms in FRA, and therefore all transfer passengers would definitely miss their connecting flights as we would land after 11pm. Despite this, the crew were extremely friendly and helpful, dealt with everybody's concerns calmly and professionally, and even served free drinks in economy. Hats off to Lufthansa ( and the ground crew that then also took care of us all very well and with patience and good humour)",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Frankfurt,July 2023,4,5,5,5,,3,4,yes
Lufthansa,3,"""there was a massive baggage delay""",17th July 2023,TRUE,"  Flight was delayed by about 60+ mins on the day due to late arrival but promised late opening of the check-in counter did not filter down to ground staff on departure despite assurances over email. No update was provided on the ground by check in staff as well. Thankfully, ground staff at the airport were helpful and we could catch the flight. Check-in service staff were not the most helpful if a bit curt in their replies. The flight itself was generally comfortable and in a well-maintained aircraft although for the price of the ticket passengers could probably do with more than a small piece of chocolate and small bottled water. On arrival, there was a massive baggage delay with many other Lufthansa arrivals affected. Some customers had baggage delayed for hours and the service queue was very long. Despite the situation, the service desk closed at the published time, advising passengers to follow up their queries with the Qr Code. No additional advice was given. After more than an hour of waiting for the baggage, my AirTag revealed that the baggage was transported to another belt far from the original belt. All in all, if I have a choice I would avoid flying with Lufthansa where possible especially on connecting flights (a testament to this is perhaps the ever-long queues at the service counters).",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bilbao to Munich,July 2023,3,3,1,1,,,2,no
Lufthansa,3,"""always an unpleasant experience""",15th July 2023,TRUE," This is becoming a rule when I fly with Lufthansa. First the staff is very rude and even unfriendly. Second, after we sit in the plane the pilot makes an announcement that something is wrong (this time it was to tell us that we were stuck without being allowed to take off for several hours and also that they had not received any water so they could not serve us drinks). Last but not least, we arrived but our luggage got stuck somewhere on the way.

Lufthansa,1,"""staff almost always unpleasant""",15th July 2023,FALSE,Literal trash. I am being charged for baggage that I wasn't charged for initially. We flew from Frankfurt to Athens and I had a carry on and a backpack. I wasn't charged anything when they had to check my carry on as checked luggage upon boarding due to their miscalculation of a “full flight” AS ALWAYS. Not a huge deal just inconvenient as Lufthansa has lost my bags before. My backpack goes under the seat so I don't understand why I'm not afforded 1 space in the luggage rack. On our way back from Athens they charged me €55 for my carryon to be checked even though it was under the weight limit. The staff is almost always unpleasant and if they weren’t the only airline option pretty much I wouldn’t be using them at all.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Frankfurt,July 2023,2,2,,1,,,3,no
Lufthansa,3,"""not a pleasant experience""",15th July 2023,FALSE," Flew from Amsterdam to Sofia and back via Frankfurt. In total, I had 4 flights and all were delayed. Disappointed to only get a small bottle of water and a small piece of chocolate on the flight. With an airline like Lufthansa I do expect more. The seats were ok, but punctuality leaves room for improvement. All my flights were delayed by at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour. With a layover of 1 hour in Frankfurt both ways this was quite stressful. On my return flight the app did not work properly. We landed in Frankfurt 10 minutes late, however it took well over 30 minutes to arrive in the terminal due to the long taxi and bus ride. At this time my connecting flight already closed boarding according to the app and I still had to go through passport control. Much to my frustrations a group on my flight with another connecting flight, which departed later than mine, was offered special treatment to ensure they made their connecting flight, while nothing was provided to me. Fortunately, my connecting flight was also delayed, so I was still able to make my flight, but it was not a pleasant experience. I think it speaks for itself that none of my flight were on time and the service on board was lacking.",A320 family,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Sofia via Frankfurt,July 2023,3,3,1,2,,,2,no

Lufthansa,1,"""retched experience with Lufthansa""",10th July 2023,TRUE,"  My flight to a Frankfurt connection was diverted to Dusseldorf because the Frankfurt airport closed due to a drone & security. The pilot said we were refuelling. Everyone thought the plane would then return to Frankfurt. Instead, without any direction, we were told to exit the plane. We had no idea what was going on, eventually ending up in baggage collection. Half an hour later, a staff member showed up & said we should collect our luggage & would be driven back to Frankfurt on buses. This took 5 hours. By then, everyone had missed their onward flights. No one met us as 5 huge bus loads of passengers exited at Frankfurt. Again, no one knew where to go. Eventually, everyone found their way to Lufthansa Rebooking. I stood in line 3 hours.  At this point no one had been offered water or food. After at least an hour in line, some snacks & water showed up, the first & only customer consideration. The agent who waited on me did not have a clue what she was doing. She wanted to book me on a flight to Chicago, long layover, then PHL. I said I wanted to be booked on the same non-stop flight to PHL. After an hour, she rebooked me for that flight leaving 3 days later, gave me a voucher for the night, & said I had to come back to the airport the next day to get a voucher for the following night. The hotel was a 20 min. shuttle bus drive. Next morning, I left the hotel on the return shuttle bus early in order to get back by the last shuttle bus at 10:50 or wait for next one at 16:20. I had to wait in line again in the Rebooking line another 2 hours to get another voucher. The agent went into my ticketing & said she had to go upstairs to documentation because of a problem with the previous rebooking. Apparently I had been rebooked via Chicago one day & a second booking direct to PHL 3 days later. When she returned, she handed me to another agent. He rebooked me on a direct flight to PHL with EW Discovery but one day later not 2 days later. He gave me a voucher for a different hotel & complicated directions to taking the train there. I said my luggage was at the previous hotel I was sent to yesterday. He said he didn’t know anything about yesterday. He was very rude & condescending. By the time I was finished with these 2 people, I had missed my shuttle which meant I could not repack my luggage & checkout by noon. I called the hotel & had no choice but to book another night there which I had to pay for out of pocket.  When my rebooking confirmations came through, I received 2 for check-in: One for the next day, the other for the following day, same flights. I checked in to the flight for the following day. The plane did take off the next day, & I was on it. But EW Discovery economy was the tightest seating I have ever been in.  Needless to say, had I known I’d be booked in a sardine can on a partner airline I never heard of for $2200, I would never have booked Lufthansa. And because of the worst customer service ever & uncomfortable partner airline, I never will again.

Lufthansa,2,"""flight tickets increased drastically""",9th July 2023,FALSE,"  I had round trip via Frankfurt to Brittany, France. Prices for flight tickets increased drastically from 2019 to 2023. But what about quality of Lufthansa's service onboard, it has gone down in comparison with the pre-pandemic era. Forget about quality and tasty meals and beverages for free. It is not anymore included in flight ticket prices as well as choice of it. Onboard Lufthansa staff throws you one small bottle of the cheapest water from Denmark in plastic bottle and after 10 g bar of the cheap chocolate.

Lufthansa,2,"""food was basically inedible""",6th July 2023,FALSE,"  I flew this flight with Lufthansa a few months ago and I still can't get over just how much of a bad experience it was. The meal service was particularly bad, the food was basically inedible. The breakfast just before arriving in Bangkok was unbelievable. I was really hungry after the very small portion of pasta the night before and was looking forward to the breakfast. It consisted of a yoghurt and a sandwich which I think was ham. I couldn't say for definite since it was frozen solid as was the yoghurt. The flight attendant couldn't care less after I pointed it out to her. Even had we got metal cutlery it wouldn't have cut through it, the plastic stuff we got was extremely cheap rubbish. We never got to see the attendants after the one serving from the drinks trolley. On the return journey from Munich to Manchester I fancied a gin and tonic only to be told it would be 7.50.

The entertainment system did not work on the way back to the states and the flight attendant tried to get it restarted and didn'twork. No USB to charge phone since it's an older airplane. Worse is when we landed in Chicago yesterday, we still don't have our luggage a day later. All passengers on flight LH430 - after waiting for over an hour were told to file a delayed lost luggage online. The cargo door could not be open was the answer they gave us. You need to do better Luftansa, we spent 7k for 3 people and an infant with you and your flight partners.

Then we had to rent a more expensive car because our original reservation was missed due to the late flight. On top of all that they lost one of our bags and returned it to us 3 days later in terrible condition. The bag looked like it had been dragged though dirt and beat up. We had to spend even more money to buy clothes for the 3 days we didn’t have the bag. I tried numerous times to call and email and you get absolutely no help from anyone.

Lufthansa,1,"""they do not respect their customers""",1st July 2023,TRUE," In June 2022, we were going back to Montreal from Toulouse (with a layover in Munich). The plane left Toulouse over an hour late, which made us miss the flight from Munich to Montreal. We had to wait 4h in line to get the tickets for the hotel/cab + plane tickets for the next available flight (24h later) to Montreal. The next day we got into the plane, the plane was nasty. I tried putting my bottle of water in the compartment in front of my seat and as I reached to put it I touched used, humid Kleenex from the previous passengers. I was about to take a picture of it when the stewardess saw me and changed our seats. The new seats we’re as nasty as the previous one, coffee stains on the table, visible old journals in the compartment, hairs on the other table, etc. That was at the time when Airlines companies were supposed to clean the planes very well in between flights (for obvious COVID reasons), we we’re also still required to wear a mask at all times. Two days after my arrival, I wrote a complaint and asked for the legal compensation for the missed flight (over 24h forced stay in Munich) and I also complained about the dirty plane, asking for a supervisor to call me. I did not receive and calls, only a weird email asking me for my banking information, which I replied to saying I wasn’t comfortable giving this information that way. It took 5 months (November 2022) before I received another email stating that it was a safe way to give my information through the website. I did send my banking information through the website shortly after that, reiterating that I also wanted to receive a call from a supervisor. I didn’t receive any calls nor any compensation whatsoever. I tried contacting the customer service department a couple of times, they would either hang up on me or make me wait for hours until the line would magically cut. At one point I was able to speak to someone, who confirmed to me it could take a couple months for me to receive something. Its been over a year now, I still haven’t received the call, I warned them that I would file a complaint to the OTC, asked them to settle this with me before, they didn’t reach out to me. I filled the complaint, still wrote to them that I was willing to settle it in a friendly way but they still refuse to call me.

When asked, they said that the plane was overbooked, and they couldn't wait for us. So they take off late and the same company doesn't care to wait 5 min. Instead they will run away early, because they sell the tickets twice. They made us wait in the airport for over 12 hours to wait for the next flight, and gave use $15 voucher to eat. $15 for the whole day? This was the biggest joke. The worse experience ever in 20 years. Stay away for Lufthansa! In the plane, the screen wasn't working, was so boring not being able to watch a movie.

Second leg, FRA -LAX - again same issue with boarding. Business class - only one person at gate checking boarding passes and everyone pushing to try to get through. No orderly queue. Flat bed more comfortable because there was a mattress pad.

Lufthansa,1,"""Never again Lufthansa""",25th June 2023,FALSE,"  Luggage payment was not included in the ticket price. I had to pay extra 75 CAD at each airport. None of them accepted cash. In Toronto, the payment machine did not recognise my Visa card. I was sent to another counter where they issued a card with 75 dollars in it plus 9 CAD for the service. In Sofia, the card worked but instead of 101 units in local currency, I was charged 101 CAD (I lost another 26 dollars). One may say 35 dollars lost is not a big deal. True, but the problem is with the nerves. On top of the stress with checking in, security check and wasting time (you must be at the airport 3 hours before the departure time and departure was late by a whole hour) comes the stupid requirement to pay separately for the luggage. Not online or within the ticket price, but at the airport. Never again Lufthansa.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Sofia,June 2023,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Lufthansa,6,"""they were totally inflexible""",25th June 2023,TRUE,"  I flew from São Paulo to Frankfurt on the 1st June. The flight was almost completely full. On this 12-hour flight, we were placed in seats next to a partition, with no possibility of any movement to recline the backrest. The seat was only completely vertical. I spoke with the flight attendants about the problem. I noticed that there were 10 or 15 free seats in economy-plus / premium economy. I talked to the team again, I spoke about the discomfort of traveling for 12 hours in that seat, but they were totally inflexible. The 10-15 economy-plus seats were empty for the entire flight, and we had the backrest upright.

In addition, I lost my baggage because of it and nobody at the customer service point could help out. Person A (from Lufthansa) would say a completely different thing to person B, and so on (I talked to a number of Lufthansa employees, and each of them said different things). I had to get my connecting bus ticket three times (they made me miss my bus three times because of my lost luggage). The worst was when I was approaching one of the employees and with a very unfriendly tone, she said: ""Nobody can help you now. Come back tomorrow morning."" I was roaming around the airport at midnight for hours asking them and that's what they told me. They even do not give me any compensation during the lost baggage period.

No information or explanation given other continued changes to departure time on boards. Boarding procedures chaotic. Although cabin bag size restriction is published, this was not enforced, leading difficulties in place correct sized bags in overhead lockers. Choice of food available for purchase on board very poor. Cabin staff unhelpful. Information given re onward flight affected by delay given re other flights but not to London Heathrow. On arrival in Frankfurt no stand available causing further delay, when stand was allocated, plane had to move to another since offloading equipment was in the wrong place! Before disembarking told London flight was being held for 15 minutes. After a race across the concourse, arrived at gate in time to board, only to be told flight had already closed no information.

Lufthansa,1,"""A very pleasant flight""",16th June 2023,TRUE,"  After checking in online and receiving my boarding pass I noticed that in the LH App my seat was not the same as the one on the boarding pass but 1 row in front, separating my wife and myself. When dropping off the bag at LH in Munich I was informed that my original seat has an issue with its electronic and as a precaution I was assigned a different seat. The check in agent then rearranged both my wife's and my seat to perfect different couple seat and all was really super. I was impressed that Lufthansa realised that there is a seat issue in advance and proactively cleared all issues. Boarding on the 15th of June for LH 494 was not as smooth as it could have been but acceptable. In flight service was top notch with very friendly and efficient attendants, meals very very well presented and of the highest quality. Plane was clean and in-flight entertainment good. LH Business Class seats are a matter of taste and admittedly I prefer those to the cocoon like atmosphere of others and when travelling as a couple just perfect.

However for this short flight it was adequate. Service onboard was friendly, if a little mechanical. Food served was pretty nice with very tender beef with mashed celeriac and, a chocolate pudding and delicious bread roll and butter.

The app was very useful and worked perfectly, we were able to check in and download boarding passes without any issues, information via the app was useful not having travelled via Frankfurt before and directions we needed to follow on arrival were of particular use.

Everyone was lovely and things were okay. On my way back from Nice to canada. The staff asked me to pay for my carry on luggage as the measurements were bigger than usual. I informed them that I had no issues coming to nice with that same luggage and was checked in by a Lufthansa employee. The customer service at Nice airport was horrible. I should’ve been informed of this when I was departing from Canada.  There are no real standards or rules. And obviously it varies from airport to airport, which is extremely stressful.

Cabin crew was not approachable or friendly, almost felt like they have been sent to do their jobs on gunpoint. Ran out of food options too quick and what we got was inedible by any standards. Seats were very hard and uncomfortable, pillow case and blankets were very dirty. Tray table was not cleaned. Worst of all, no headphones were provided on a 10 hour flight nor was the WiFi working.

Lufthansa,5,"!frequent flyer programme atrocious""",12th June 2023,TRUE," I flew Lufthansa three times last year (twice to India and once to Japan). The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage. It's truly pathetic and unworthy of a major airline.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bangalore via Frankfurt,December 2022,2,3,2,4,4,3,3,no
Lufthansa,2,"""Very disappointing and infuriating""",10th June 2023,TRUE,Very disappointing and infuriating. Paid for upgraded seats - given the two middle seats of a row of four - hideous when going to the bathroom several times over a long flight. Cabin crew annoyed that we were not happy about our money being stolen by their company for services not given. Practically threw our food and drink at us the whole flight - it was ordinary at best anyway. To give credit we did arrive more or less on time and safely so really that is what you ultimately want. However then ensued several months of emails trying to at least get a refund for the services not supplied - no joy with this and in fact some very weird emails promising refunds which never materialised. What a waste of time - would never fly with Lufthansa again and definitely would not recommend.

Lufthansa,3,"""not take any responsibility for this""",9th June 2023,FALSE,"  I ordered an exit seat that allows for more space for your legs and paid 85$ for it. The ground steward confirmed that I have this seat. However, when I boarded, I was given a different seat. The flight attendant apologized and said that I should reach out for the customers' care for reimbursement. I sent 4 letters to customers' care, each time required to provide more explanations for this very simple event. Finally, they answered that the company does not take any responsibility for this and that they will not reimburse me. Bottom line: bought something that was not provided and was not reimbursed.

Lufthansa,1,"""Real problem was the luggage""",6th June 2023,TRUE," Problem was not the flight, although we had to run for the stop-over in Frankfurt (don't take a stop-over of 1.20 hrs). Real problem was the luggage. Had to pay 500 euros extra for 2 extra suitcases (OK) but our stroller/baby car went for free. This stroller/baby car consists of 2 parts, the bed and the frame with wheels. The frame with wheels never arrived in Sao Paulo (due to Brazilian law you have to pick up your luggage at the first entry in Brazil). Made a report via the Lufthansa website and then it's waiting but nothing happened. Called the luggage department 3 times and they just tell you to wait. Although they ask about a list of contents, which I already filled in . They gave me an email address to mail to send the pictures to, afterwards you get a nice email confirmation. But the pictures are never added to case! After 5 days still nothing. It looks like the luggage department can't just call Frankfurt and asked if it arrived there, then call Sao Paulo or Amsterdam lost luggage (only 3 calls or 3 computer systems, that shouldn't be that difficult). During the calls they constantly ask you for the list of contents, which I filled in off-course, but you can't upload of picture of the lost item (then it would be found pretty quickly). Yes, I can claim 50% of the value, but strollers in Brazil are different and not as good. They should just find the stroller frame with wheels. If the bed part can arrive, why not the stroller? So flying with Lufthansa can be fine or cheap, but if you luggage is lost, you are doomed and can't even speak to somebody normal.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Belo Horizonte via Frankfurt & Sao Paulo,May 2023,3,3,4,1,4,,1,no
Lufthansa,1,"""would not recommend travelling with Lufthansa""",6th June 2023,FALSE,"  We had a flight from Brussels to Vancouver with a change in Frankfurt. Normally we would board in Vancouver 4th of June at 11am to start a cruise. Our flight in Brussels had a delay of 70 minutes, so we missed our connection in Frankfurt. Still on the plane, taxiing to the gate, we received an email that our flight to Vancouver was rebooked to Monday 5th June, that was not ok because the cruise started on the 4th. At the customer desk, after a waiting time of 90 minutes, the lady was very rude, she gave us a flight with a stopover in Chicago and a (theoretical) arrival in Vancouver on the 4th at 11h 33am. That was too late, by no means we could arrive on time to board our cruise ship (11am). The lady was constantly pointing her watch to make clear that her shift was over, she only spent 10 minutes to solve our problem. She threw the new flight schedule on the desk, turned around and went away. I was totally in shock. In our life we have made a lot of travels to all kind of continents and with all kind of carriers. Never, never were we treated in such a brutal, disrespectful manner. We took a train back home, a sad ending of our dream cruise. I would not recommend travelling with Lufthansa.",A320neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Vancouver via Frankfurt,June 2023,2,2,1,1,,,1,no
Lufthansa,4,"""lacking the premium experience""",4th June 2023,TRUE,"  Any longer flights will no longer be done with Lufthansa. They are charging premium prices but lacking the premium experience. The food was terrible, the seats were cramped and uncomfortable. WiFi came at a premium even for messages only. Many of the changes made by Lufthansa over the years remind me of budget airlines like easy jet. The very reason I flew with Lufthansa was the more Premium experience, such as being able to choose a seat on check-in free of charge. Ironically, the flight to San Francisco, our first stop on a road trip, was with United who had great food, very generous service and comfortable seats. It's sad seeing what's happened to this once great airline.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Munich,May 2023,1,4,1,3,3,1,3,no
Lufthansa,1,"""not given the special meal""",31st May 2023,TRUE,"  Absolutely awful at each level. Lufthansa has completely lost it. Under the pretext of COVID, Lufthansa has become extremely cheap. I have been a miles and more loyal passenger for at least a decade. During booking the lady was extremely rude and would not confirm if tickets were refundable if cancelled within 24 hours. In Washington and in Frankfurt the food was extremely sub standard and choices limited and on both flights I was not given the special meal that I had ordered. I have specific dietary requirements and despite confirming the meal twice before travel, they messed up my meal. During my flight from Frankfurt to Riyadh, the boarding was a horror. Passengers were not segregated according to class and it was almost a free for all. The ground staff was extremely rude. I requested that lady that perhaps passengers could be segregated according to class and made to board according to zones. To which she replied sarcastically how thankful she was to learn from me. I wrote several emails to Lufthansa asking them to address this and never got a reply. ",,Business,Business Class,Washington to Riyadh via Frankfurt,April 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Lufthansa,5,"""lack of service from their staff""",29th May 2023,TRUE,"  I was not able to do this online myself as their online booking system kept telling me to contact customer service for any add ons. I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn’t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn’t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn’t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don’t make it easy on the customer. It’s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don’t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa’s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa’s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn’t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn’t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don’t speak English? She would say “Sir you have to call this number for help” “Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues” “Sir we have no manager here to help you” I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn’t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter. We told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldn’t understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available. Lufthansa needs to take responsibility for the lack of service from their staff behind the scenes. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Barcelona via Toronto,May 2023,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,no
Lufthansa,2,"""Really bad service""",29th May 2023,TRUE," Really bad service, they cancelled our flight to Frankfurt 3 hours before departures, giving us no option to reebok. We had to flight to Namibia and had everything organized the option they gave us was to reroute on 2 days later losing money and time. So we booked a train that we paid ourselves, we did several claims and calls - no answers, no help, no refunds. We paid for a ticket and for a train, a lot of stress, the train was full and we had to stand for 4 hours. I'm writing this out of frustration, we live in Germany we have Lufthansa credit card, the miles and more program. It is getting after covid the worst airline, expensive and with bad customer service. It is not like before. Do not book with Lufthansa, do not subscribe the credit card, do not join the miles and more program.

Lufthansa,2,"""they have practised cost cutting""",26th May 2023,TRUE,"  Lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa’s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here’s the “verdict”: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. I can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",A321-200,Business,Business Class,Munich to Catania,May 2023,1,2,1,1,,,1,no

At the check in Lufthansa offered an upgrade for premium economy. I payed for the upgrade and next day to the airport I was told that I am on stand buy at Munich. When I arrived at Munich, I was told that I don't have the upgrade because Lufthansa sold more upgrades than the available seats they have.

I am keep asking about the compensation, money transfer, and I am only getting back basically copy and paste massages that they have transferred the funds and I need to wait few more days.

Lufthansa,8,"""some parts could be improved""",21st May 2023,TRUE,"  Frankfurt to Chicago in Business. My journey started with a friendly check-in in Frankfurt. Although the Business lounge before entrance to Z gates was very busy, there were enough seats. Food and drink options were very good with a big choice of alcoholic (sparkling wine, spirits and beer on tap) and non-alcoholic drinks. On board the service was fantastic. The female crew member in my section was very friendly and attentive. Business seats in 2-2-2 configuration with a lack of privacy and storage space, but they are still comfortable. IFE had a very good selection, although the quality oft the screen could have been better. The food was very good, both taste and presentation. Drink selection was great including Champagne, a great Spanish red wine and raspberry brandy. One negative aspect was the missing free WIFI for Business class passengers. While there were different options available for reasonable prices, I think WIFI should be free for passengers in Business Class.

Lufthansa,3,"""I will not use this carrier again""",19th May 2023,TRUE,"  This review is of the extremely poor customer service. It all began in January 2023 when I purchased two RT tickets from Denver to Athens, Greece. The first leg of the the trip, Denver to Munich was a Lufthansa flight for which I paid $185 for seat assignments Row 18 H/K.  Fast forward to flight check in on April 29, 2023 and my seat assignments are not what I reserved. An hour and half later, and finally speaking to a Lufthansa rep and she cannot help me or refund my purchased seats. I am instructed to apply for a refund on-line after travel has been completed. It is now one week since I have returned from Athens and I have not been able to receive a refund. The on-line system won't recognize my booking code even though it shows ""verified"", and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times, and on other calls I am told that the ""system is down"", ""you have to do this on-line"", ""supervisors are unavailable to assist"", and ""due to the high call volume, I can't get you assistance"". The last call ended with the representative telling me to ""call back in 15 minutes"". I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center. My actual flight experience is another review and equally poor. Lufthansa should be ashamed of all aspects of their service.

On the ground there was no service provided to me to rebook me to another flight or offer any remedy help to get me back to Hong Kong - Cathay Pacific was guilty too. After, I returned to HK, I contacted Lufthansa for compensation. Their reply was “bad luck” and the request for compensation was not entertained.

Lufthansa,3,"""I never will fly with them again""",17th May 2023,TRUE,Very bad airline. 2 delays on both flights. Better off with budget airlines as easyjet or Ryan Air.

Lufthansa,3,"""basinet seat is overbooked"" ",15th May 2023,TRUE,"  Booking basinet seat has been the terrible experience. We booked bassinet seat on February 2023 via their customer care and when we reached airport to board on April 2023, they told us that basinet seat is overbooked and we do not have the basinet seat. Same experience in the return flight too. We had to fight at the counter for almost half an hour at the time of boarding to get us basinet seat at the end. So it was never double booked but they lied to us. Also, very bad experience with their coordination with partner airline. Their partner airline got cancelled and rescheduled but Lufthansa did not update the itinerary. I had to call them to update it but guess what on the day before flying , they randomly cancelled our booking again with the partner airline. Overall, I spent about 10 hours in one week fixing the airline reservation issue as well as basinet issue. Will never book with airline ever again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Denver via Munich,May 2023,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,no

Lufthansa,1,"""I expected much better treatment""",11th May 2023,TRUE,"  
I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three times,  For the high price of a business class ticket, I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.

Lufthansa,1,"""horrible April Fools trick""",11th May 2023,TRUE,"  
My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter. With 2 hours before flight departure, the counter agent informed us that Lufthansa has incorrectly rebooked the flight with wrong ticket numbers and we could not get on the flight.",A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Venice via Frankfurt,April 2023,,,,1,,,1,no

There was a strike so at the airport they rerouted me over Munich on a flight not affected by the strike. No problem, it happens. My flight to Munich, unfortunately, left with delay so I missed the connection in Munich. And then it started. Since it was already late the Lufthansa staff in Munich to just organize your own hotel and they would provide a refund after which they just closed the office. Now they refuse to refund the hotel.

They were willing to convert the amount we paid into a flight credit. They were not able to provide any written confirmation of it, but we thought we are in good hands. In 2022, our son was born with a rare genetic disease. Of course, we were unable to travel with him, and did not focus on our travel credit. Contacting the customer service this year, they informed us that the credit expired (with no previous notification, or alert).

Lufthansa,1,"""suitcase was no where to be found""",5th May 2023,TRUE,"  If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don’t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you. As Per your email, we regret to hear that your baggage was delayed at your destination. We can imagine what it meant for you to travel and not have your essential items as you intended. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused to you on this occasion. Liability for baggage is clearly regulated by law, and we must fulfill certain criteria in order to be able to meet your request for compensation. The passenger must indicate the damage amount and prove it with the help of receipts, e.g., sales receipts or credit card receipts. As much as we understand your irritation, we are unable to comply with your request for reimbursement of the expenses for your replacement purchases.

Lufthansa,3,"""the first and last time""",2nd May 2023,FALSE," Lufthansa allows a standard hand luggage 55cm 8kg plus 1 item (laptop bag, no weight requirement). Entering the plane, there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin. That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting. I will certainly never use Lufthansa again, it was the first and last time I did and I would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all!",,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Hamburg,May 2023,3,1,1,2,,,2,no

Lufthansa,1,"""they could not provide any hotels""",22nd April 2023,TRUE,"  Our flight was delayed from for 3 hours it then took off and diverted to a different airport 3 hours later. It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions (which happens) what was not acceptable however, was not providing any food. By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled! I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the ever-so-helpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue!

On the way back the crew were smiling and very helpful. The food was good on the way to USA, worse on the way from USA but I’ve been traveling there for almost 20 years and that is always the case.

Lufthansa,3,"""standards have drastically changed""",16th April 2023,TRUE,"  The last time I flew with them my return flight was canceled 1 week prior to my trip (and the year before it was cancelled during my trip!). The proposed option was to rebook us (myself and my husband) onto a Eurowings Discover flight! This is outrageous as an offer as that is a low-cost flight and we booked Lufthansa. Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly.

There was no in-airport support at Istanbul, we were denied access to the business class lounges when they cancelled our flight (which was their fault) and offered absolutely no compensation or support.

Everything was hidden behind a pay wall. I payed 18 USD for their second tier “fast” in flight wifi that would not even suffice to write this review at the time of my flight.

Flying long-haul with them for the first time after the pandemic, how things have changed! It was the worst in flight experience. The hardest seats one can possibly imagine for an 11h flight. Terrible food, and in the smallest quantities, no snacks, no fruit for in between. And the entertainment console, I could not even imagine something this terrible can exist in 2023. It was touch screen but mostly an instrument of torture for your fingers, and the slowest thing one can imagine. Not too great of a selection either. Paid internet available.

The boarding process is inefficient. The plane left late and arrived late. With a narrow time with the connecting flight, we have to use the back door of the plane and take a shuttle to get to the airport terminal and then go through security again. In Frankfurt, the desk assistant was slow . People are lining up to ask questions and to ask for upgrade and about 20 people on the line waiting for assistance.  The boarding process is again inefficient, slow, and late again. We have to go down steps to board the plane again. I will never take Lufthansa again. No TV on the plane from Amman to Frankfurt and plane amenities are old and no WiFi. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Houston,March 2023,1,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Lufthansa,1,"""my worst experience ever""",27th March 2023,TRUE,"  It was my worst experience ever. My flight was from Greece to Dublin via Munich. We were not aware that in the Munich airport had some technical issues and the majority of European flights, were being cancelled. Although the pilot prior take off from Greece and due to a flight delay mentioned about these issues in Munich no one bothered to inform us that we might lose our flights and be stuck in Munich. The following 2 days it was known that the staff in Munich airport was in strike so no flights. During the flight I found out that my flight from Munich to Dublin was cancelled. When I asked the flight attendant what am I supposed to do and why they did not inform us earlier to find another option to travel to Dublin, she replied you may be able to travel to Dublin on Tuesday, 3 days later.",,Business,Business Class,Thessaloniki to Munich,March 2023,4,1,3,1,1,5,1,no
Lufthansa,1,"""does not meet expectations""",25th March 2023,FALSE," I think the fact that Lufthansa states “We are aware that due to the steady increase in personal and business travel, we are currently unable to provide you with the excellent service you have come to expect from us” says it all. When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination. If you as an airline or business cannot uphold your end of the agreement, and continuously fail to meet the agreement, then it is my opinion that refunds should be provided. I will NEVER fly this airline again and will be sharing this story broadly with my friends, family, and any acquaintance on my socials.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Toulouse via Frankfurt,March 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Lufthansa,1,"""disgraceful and very disappointing""",24th March 2023,TRUE,"  It is now over a month since Lufthansa confirmed refunds in relation to a cancelled flight. Despite both email and verbal confirmations of refunds, Lufthansa have yet to honour the refund payment. It is unacceptable that a refund would be confirmed and then not actually paid, particularly in the circumstance where I had booked another flight with Lufthansa in order to return from Munich following my original flight cancellation. I have now in effect paid twice for my family to fly home. What makes this all the more frustrating, is that despite completing numerous “Customer Feedback forms” on the Lufthansa website, no one is responding to my queries and if any response is received it is an automated one. I have attempted three times to speak with a customer services representative and on every occasion they state that the “refunds department” is dealing with the request. At no point have I been able to speak to the refunds department and at this stage I believe Lufthansa to not be honouring the refund and frustrating my ever attempt to receive clarity on the situation in an effort to deter me from pursuing further. It is easily the worst customer service experience I have had with an airline. Which is saying a lot given issues experienced during the pandemic. Truly disgraceful and very disappointing.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Dublin,February 2023,3,5,,1,,,1,no
Lufthansa,3,"""became a below average airline""",23rd March 2023,TRUE,"  BUD-MUC-MIA: IFE did not work, headheadset is outdated and uncomfortable. Food was below average and for a 10 hour flight after food service they provided only a small bag of crackers. No additional drinks or crackers were avalable in the galley. When asked for more I got another small cracker. MIA-MUC-BUD: IFE touchscreen is a disaster. Booked payed seats and they reseated us for what? IFE did not work on those seats! Only one soft drink service for a 9 hour flight, dinner was average but the morning breakfast was the most disgusting sandwich. Luthansa has definitely became a below average airline.

Lufthansa,1,"""They are a really bad airline""",21st March 2023,TRUE,"  Customer service is rude because they know they don't need to be otherwise. I asked in Budapest for information on how to leave a comment and they said that there is no way to do so. They said they are not Lufthansa they are just the contracted agency. Therefore they said they do not need to follow Lufthansa rules. So, even though I checked with a Lufthansa representative, they said it is my responsibility to check with them. I was only able to bring my purse, so I am now going to have to hand carry all of my laptops, iPad, cords. I have no bag for them because they don't fit in my purse. This is the most illogical thing I have ever encountered. I will do every thing I can to not take Lufthansa. They are a really bad airline",,Business,Economy Class,Budapest to Denver via Munich,March 2023,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Lufthansa,1,"""Legroom in Economy was below minimum""",18th March 2023,TRUE,Legroom in Economy was below minimum. With the Backrest in front of you at the back position you cannot eat or have a tablet on the table.  The seat becomes uncomfortable after 3-4 hours. One snack (vegan Wrap) and one Meal (vegetarian Pasta or Chicken with couscous) was served - Taste was ok. Wine was offered free of charge. Crew was not very friendly. Infotainment was good.

Lufthansa,9,"""a joy flying with them""",17th March 2023,TRUE,"  Definitely not a big fan of Lufthansa but this time it was a joy flying with them. A super motivated crew, joyful and friendly: what a difference it makes (one might question why we have to mention this, nowadays). Food was minimal because of the short hop (45 mins flight) but actually very nice.

Lufthansa,5,"""Fares are high, service is low""",14th March 2023,TRUE,"  FRA-MXP and LIN-FRA in December. Two uneventful one-hour flights. Planes are clean and in a good condition, but service level is minimal. A bottle of water and a piece of chocolate is all you get. No further drinks or snacks available, not even for purchase! I was looking forward to get a coffee in the morning but was disappointed. Crew gave out water and chocolate, then disappeared. WIFI didn't work on both flights and Inflight Magazine is gone. Fares are high, service is low, that’s Lufthansa now. Nevertheless recommended because of their reliability.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,December 2022,5,2,2,5,1,1,2,yes
Lufthansa,5,"""Service is now worse than budget carriers""",11th March 2023,FALSE,Service is now worse than budget carriers. A free bottle of water and a chocolate don't make up for the ridiculous fees for changing seats etc. Planes are clean staff are friendly but service is no better than a budget carrier and pricing is premium. Every opportunity to extract money is taken - you can't even pick a seat at check in and when a seat is allocated the fees to change are high. The app often doesn't work as it should and presents errors preventing you from making changes to bookings.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Manchester,March 2023,5,4,1,4,1,1,3,no
